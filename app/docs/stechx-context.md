2. Define services (web / app / video / AI automation)  
3. Define user types (Clients, Creators)  
4. Define overall theme (dark futuristic Apple-like)

3. Define endpoints with:  
   - path  
   - method  
   - request schema  
   - response schema  
   - error models  
   - auth rules if any  
4. Define shared data models  
5. Define validation rules  
6. Produce a final JSON schema file  
7. Lock the contract (immutable)  

Instruction to Claude:  
“Generate the complete API Contract for StechX. This contract must not change later.”
